# DAC List
A list of companies/stores that engaged in Honey's partner program.

I have to give these places the benefit of the doubt: they might not've known how badly Honey was controlling the amount of coupons a user could use. Some of these stores have limits of 10 coupons. The developers of these modules were the Honey Team.

# What is a DAC?
I'm not quite sure, but if you look at `h0.js`, there appear to be these bundled modules (probably separate node modules) that are all given fields and or names with "dac".

Some of these modules are called "Acorns" or "Meta Functions". Not sure what those mean.

Keep in mind that what I have is just from my extension, possibly in other regions of the world or other browsers different things show up.

AFAIK the IDs in these "DACs" correspond to https://cdn-checkout.joinhoney.com/honey-checkout/stores.json
