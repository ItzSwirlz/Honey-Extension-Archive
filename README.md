# Honey-Extension-Archive
Archiving the Honey extension, known for stealing possibly billions of dollars (Last update: Dec 12 2024 before MegaLag's video)

# What is this?
This is an archive of the Honey extension on Chrome Web Store. Specifically, version 17.0.2. If anyone has older versions of the extension, feel free to PR them.

These are likely obfuscated and or minimized in some way but the goal is to truly see in the code what was going on.

# Reverse engineering
Because of my own time, I probably will not entirely reverse engineer the extension and try to figure everything out, but everyone else is more than welcome to.
