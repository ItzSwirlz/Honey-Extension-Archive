# Honey-Extension-Archive
Archiving the Honey extension, known for stealing possibly billions of dollars (Last update: Dec 12 2024 before MegaLag's video)

# What is this?
This is a documented archive of the Honey extension on Chrome Web Store. Specifically, version 17.0.2. If anyone has older versions of the extension, feel free to PR them.

The original extension without any changes (such as comments, naming, or formatting) can be found here on the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/honey-extension-17.0.2 or in the Archive/ folder.

These are likely obfuscated and or minimized in some way but the goal is to truly see in the code what was going on.

# Documentation
Because of my own time, I probably will not entirely investigate and document the extension and try to figure everything out, but everyone else is more than welcome to.

However, I have found that there is indeed cookie setting and special handling for special online stores, presumably ones part of Honey's partner program.
